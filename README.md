### ✋ Hello, MZEN here!

I am Mike Zeng, a senior at West Senior High school. I have taken substantial CS classes at University of Iowa, essentially completing my bachelors. I am currently pursing CS further through graduate classes, research, and independent studies, most which concern to fields of networks and deep learning,

In the meantime, I study for USACO and Codeforces, and run the West Computing Club.
